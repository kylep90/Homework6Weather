I enjoyed using the APIs in this homework. However I am struggling writing DRY code and using the localStorage.
I am requesting a tutor session to try and sort this out.

Apologies again for the HTML layout. I personally prefer working in the backend.

Update:17.05.2020
I had a tutor session who advised me to use functions
I wanted help with the localStorage, but my console keeps crashing when I open the Application tab!
